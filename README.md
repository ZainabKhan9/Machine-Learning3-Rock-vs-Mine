# Machine-Learning3-Rock-vs-Mine
The "Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project focuses on predicting whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), and logistic regression, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate classification.
